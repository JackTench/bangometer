# The Bang-Out-O-Meter
A funny spiceworks API toy. Works out if you need to start knocking people out based on how many tickets are open.

Instructions:
1. Download bang.py and place it in a folder.
2. Navigate to on.spiceworks.com/api/tickets.json
3. Right click anywhere on the page, and select "Save As".
4. Download the file (be sure to keep the name tickets.json) and place it in the same folder as bang.py
5. Run the python file and the Bang-Out-O-Meter will calculate the rest!
